Q #: Explain the three main ways to target elements.
Now, in order to style certain elements on the page, you need to know how to specify those elements. There are three main ways to target something:

By tag, e.g. you can target the body or p or span
By the class you’ve specified in your HTML. For example, if you have three list items with the class nav-item you can target them with .nav-item
By the ID you’ve specified in your HTML. For example, if you have a link with the ID home-button you can target it with #home-button
/* tag */
body { ... }
/* class */
.nav-item { ... }
/* id */

Pseudo elements are used to style particular parts of an element, rather than the whole thing. For example, you can use it to style the first line or first letter of a paragraph, text you’ve selected, or you can use it to insert text or shapes before or after an element.

They always start with a double colon - although a single colon is still allowed for backwards compatibility - and they look like this:

p::first-line { ... }
span::first-letter { ... }
::selection { ... }
.header::after { ... }
.tooltip::before { ... }

Q #:  What are pseudo classes and what are they used for?
Pseudo classes are similar to pseudo elements, but instead of styling a part of an element, they apply styles when an element is in a certain state. For example, you could style a button differently based on whether the user has their mouse pointer over it, or when they click the button.

Another common use case is to style only certain occurrences of elements in a row. For example, styling the first tab in a series of tabs, or every second tab.

They all start with a single colon and look like this:

.link:hover { ... }
.link:active { ... }
.tab:first-child { ... }
.tab:last-child { ... }
.avatar:nth-child(2n) { ... }

Q #: What are functions/mixins?
Mixins are a very handy way of adding a number of styles, based on a particular input parameter. For example, you might always want to add fallback styles when adding border-radius, but you don’t necessarily know what value you might want.

@mixin border-radius($radius) {
    -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
       -moz-border-radius: $radius;
        -ms-border-radius: $radius;
            border-radius: $radius;
}

.box {
    @include border-radius(10px);
}
