Semantic Elements:

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. These elements clearly defines its content. In other terms semantic tags are those tags whose name can easily let you know which type of content take place in it. eg. <header>, <article> and <footer>.

3 )  What’s the difference between the <svg> and <canvas> elements

 The <svg> element is a container for SVG graphics. SVG has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and even bitmap images.

SVG is a language for describing 2D graphics, but <canvas> allows you to draw 2D graphics on the fly using JavaScript.

SVG is XML-based, which means that every element is available within the SVG DOM. You can attach JavaScript event handlers for an element.

In SVG, each drawn shape is remembered as an object. If attributes of an SVG object are changed, the browser can automatically re-render the shape.

Canvas is rendered pixel by pixel. In canvas, once the graphic is drawn, it is forgotten by the browser. If its position should be changed, the entire scene needs to be redrawn, including any objects that might have been covered by the graphic.
